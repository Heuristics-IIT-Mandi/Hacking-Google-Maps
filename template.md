## Introduction
A brief introduction about your design.

## Stored Data
- Describe the data attributes involved. 
- You may also explain the size of data, and how would you suggest storing it?
- Explain the data structures involved.

## Preprocessing
There must be a lot of preprocessing going on to achieve instantaneous results. Right?

## Computing Quickest/Shortest Path
- Explain the algorithm(s) used.
- Can you comment on the computation time without any heuristic?
- Mention the heuristics to speed up the computation. Time/Accuracy trade-off?
- Will you be able to reroute quickly if the user takes a different turn?

## Efficiency and Feasibility
- Theoretically, how would it perform? 
- Do you think it can work on the scale of the globe?

## References
What all sources did you use to come up with this awesome solution?

## Conclusion
Any concluding remarks? 

Throughout the document, `Flowcharts, diagrams and small code-snippets` are highly recommmended. Don't blindly copy from blogs. :)
