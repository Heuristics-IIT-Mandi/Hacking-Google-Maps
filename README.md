# Hacking the Google Maps

You must at certain point of time in your life while enjoying the luxury of navigation services like Google Maps, have thought about how it works. Right?

And now that you are in an IIT, and very much interested in Computer Science. Don't you want to make your own Google Maps? Recall all your computer science as
we want to know how you will do it.

A few pointers before you start :

* Please don't copy solutions from blogs and internet. We have kept the competition open. If you copy from blogs and it's highly likely that someone else might also do. Then your pull requests will reveal that.
* It's in the best interest for everyone that no one copies anything from any blog and puts some real efforts in thinking about the problem and coming up with innovative solutions.
* We will not only judge on correctness, i.e. how close is your solution to what we expected. We will also put efforts to understand how you reached to that solution and if there is some creativity in the solution, its a big plus!
